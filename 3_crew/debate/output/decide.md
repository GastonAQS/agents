After a thorough review of the arguments presented by both sides, I have determined that the **Pro side**, arguing that Elden Ring is the best souls-like game of all time, is the more convincing.

**Reasoning:**

The Pro side builds a comprehensive case by focusing on the evolution and expansion of the genre. Their argument is structured around four key pillars: the successful integration of open-world mechanics with traditional Souls difficulty, the depth of narrative collaboration (George R.R. Martin), technical innovations in combat (stealth and mounted combat), and the unprecedented level of critical and commercial validation. By highlighting that Elden Ring "breaks away from traditional boundaries" and allows for "non-linear" progression, the Pro side effectively demonstrates how the game solved a long-standing barrier to entry in the genre—player frustration through lack of agency—without sacrificing the core identity of a "Souls" game.

The Con side provides a respectable rebuttal, particularly regarding the "interconnectedness" and "tightly woven experience" of the original Dark Souls. This is their strongest point, as it identifies a specific design philosophy that is arguably diluted in a sprawling open world. However, the Con side relies heavily on the "legacy" and "pioneering" status of earlier titles. While being a pioneer is historically significant, it does not inherently make a game "the best" when compared to a successor that has refined and expanded those original mechanics.

The Pro side's argument regarding "tactical options" and "player freedom" carries more weight in a debate about the "best" game because it addresses the gameplay experience's depth. While the Con side suggests that these additions "dilute the challenge," they fail to provide evidence that the challenge is absent; rather, they suggest it is less "tightly paced." The Pro side counters this implicitly by noting that the evolution provides "a broader range of tactical options," suggesting a more sophisticated approach to difficulty rather than a simplification of it.

Furthermore, the Pro side successfully leverages the game's massive critical and commercial success as a "milestone in gaming history." While the Con side correctly notes that success is subjective, the sheer scale of Elden Ring's impact on the industry and its ability to maintain the "hallmark difficulty" while reaching a wider audience suggests a level of execution that surpasses its predecessors.

Ultimately, the Pro side is more convincing because it frames Elden Ring as a culmination and refinement of the genre—a "definitive milestone" that takes the foundation of the past and builds something more expansive and innovative. The Con side’s defense of the "gold standard" of the past is poignant, but it ultimately feels like an argument for historical preference rather than a demonstration of technical or narrative superiority.
