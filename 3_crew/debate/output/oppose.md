While Elden Ring has certainly made a significant impact within the souls-like genre, claiming it to be the best souls-like game of all time overlooks the notable accomplishments of its predecessors and other titles in the genre. 

First, let’s examine the essence of the original Souls series, particularly the Dark Souls trilogy, which pioneered the genre with its innovative gameplay mechanics, meticulous level design, and atmosphere. Games like Dark Souls 1 and 3 provided a tightly woven experience, where every area interconnected in a masterful way, allowing for a sense of accomplishment and mastery that is unparalleled. Ultimately, it can be argued that the constrained yet rich environment of these earlier entries creates a more immersive experience than the vast but sometimes sprawling world of Elden Ring. 

Moreover, while Elden Ring indeed introduces new features like mounted combat and a greater focus on exploration, these additions can lead to diluted challenge and a lack of the tightly paced difficulty that defined earlier titles. Many players cherish the methodical pacing and environmental storytelling found in Dark Souls, which can sometimes feel lost amidst the expansiveness and freedom of Elden Ring.

Additionally, engaging storytelling has always been a hallmark of the Souls series, with Dark Souls’ environmental storytelling often viewed as a high point. While Elden Ring benefits from a collaboration with George R.R. Martin, not all players feel the narrative structure is as compelling or cohesive as that found in the intricate lore and character development of Dark Souls. The deeper philosophies, rich mythos, and character arcs found in the earlier games form an emotional resonance many still cherish, placing those entries in a category that is hard to surpass.

Lastly, while community accolades and commercial success are relevant, they do not solely define the greatness of a game. Subjective experiences vary greatly; many players continue to argue for the emotional weight, artistic creativity, and holistic challenge of Dark Souls over the more recent titles. 

In conclusion, while Elden Ring is undoubtedly an impressive game that has broadened the horizons of the souls-like genre, it cannot be proclaimed as the best of all time without doing a disservice to the legacy and achievements of its forerunners—particularly the Dark Souls trilogy, which set the gold standard for difficulty, interconnected world design, and rich, atmospheric storytelling. The claim that Elden Ring stands unchallenged at the top is, in essence, an oversimplification of a diverse and rich genre.
